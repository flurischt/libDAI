\section{Conclusions}
We showed that pre computing values, optimizing memory accesses, loop unrolling together with scalar replacements and vectorization lead to speed-up by a factor of 8.7 to 27.4 depending on input. For our Top-N recommendation system this means that we improved the runtime on on our dataset (u1) from 21 hours to about 45 minutes. Even better, by switching to single precision we are able to maintain the same accuracy on the predictions while reducing the runtime by yet an other factor of 6, down to about 8 minutes. We believe that this shows that the idea of applying belief propagation to recommender system is not only theoretical in nature but can be applied in real world systems. Furthermore a lot of our optimisations apply not only to our concrete example but are more general. Our empirical results show that implementing those improves the BP runtime of the library by a factor of 3 (Elias TODO: 3??). Because the libDai library is widely used for belief propagation a lot of applications can benefit from our optimisations. Especially because in most applications BP takes up a significant portion of the runtime.
