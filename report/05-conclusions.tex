\section{Conclusions}

Here you need to briefly summarize what you did and why this is
important. {\em Do not take the abstract} and put it in the past
tense. Remember, now the reader has (hopefully) read the paper, so it
is a very different situation from the abstract. Try to highlight
important results and say the things you really want to get across
(e.g., the results show that we are within 2x of the optimal performance ... 
Even though we only considered the DFT, our optimization
techniques should be also applicable ....) You can also formulate next
steps if you want. Be brief.
