\section{Conclusions}

In this project an optimized recommender system using loopy belief propagation was implemented. The recommender system was built using an existing belief propagation library~\cite{Mooij_libDAI_10} which was specialized for this specific purpose. Some generalizations were sacrificed for better runtime thus not all improvements are applicable to general belief propagation. Runtime was improved by a factor of 8.7 to 27.4 depending on input. Most of this was achieved by reducing the number of floating point operations significantly (see section~\ref{sec:results}).
