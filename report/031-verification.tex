\section{Verification}\label{sec:verification}
In order to guarantee correctness across all our optimizations a continuous integration server was used. Every change was automatically compiled, run and compared with the baseline implementation. Output deviations greater than $10^{-12}$ were reported as errors. During development there were two changes to relax the verification system. In the first version a change in the order of recommended movies triggered an error. This requirement got removed because a change $ \ll 10^{-12}$ in the output could have changed the ordering even though the Top-N movies would stay the same. The second change was to lower the tolerance to $10^{0-6}$ due to the switch from double to float. Note that, even though we lowered the tolerance, switching from double to float did not have a negative impact on precision/recall.
