\section{Verification}\label{sec:verification}
In order to guarantee correctness across all our optimizations a continuous integration server~\cite{jenkins} was used. Every change was automatically compiled and run. The output was then compared with the output of the baseline implementation. Any change of output greater than $10^{-12}$ was considered an error. During development there were two changes to the verification system. First it was considered an error when the order of recommended movies changed. This requirement has been removed because a very small change in the inferred beliefs could change the ordering but the top-n movies would still be the same. The second change was necessary due to the change from float to double. For floats only changes greater than $10^{0-6}$ were considered an error. Changing from double to float did not have a negative impact on precision/recall.
