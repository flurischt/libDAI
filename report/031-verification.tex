\section{Verification}\label{sec:verification}
In order to guarantee correctness across all our optimizations a continuous integration server~\cite{jenkins} was used. Every change was automatically compiled and run. The output was then compared with the output of the baseline implementation. Any change of output greater than $10^{-6}$ was considered an error. First it was also considered an error when the order recommended movies changed. This requirement has later been removed because a very small change in the inferred beliefs could change the ordering.
