\section{Background}\label{sec:background}

%Give a short, self-contained summary of necessary
%background information. For example, assume you present an
%implementation of FFT algorithms. You could organize into DFT
%definition, FFTs considered, and cost analysis. The goal of the
%background section is to make the paper self-contained for an audience
%as large as possible. As in every section
%you start with a very brief overview of the section. Here it could be as follows: In this section 
%we formally define the discrete Fourier transform, introduce the algorithms we use
%and perform a cost analysis.

%\mypar{Discrete Fourier Transform}
%Precisely define the transform so I understand it even if I have never
%seen it before.
%
%\mypar{Fast Fourier Transforms}
%Explain the algorithm you use.
%
%\mypar{Cost Analysis}
%First define you cost measure (what you count) and then compute the
%cost. Ideally precisely, at least asymptotically. In the latter case you will need to instrument your code to count
%the operations so you can create a performance plot.
%
%Also state what is
%known about the complexity (asymptotic usually) 
%about your problem (including citations).
