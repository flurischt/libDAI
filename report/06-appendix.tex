\section{Further Work}
To improve the significance of the optimizations performed in this project some future work is proposed. We would like to extend our code to support vectorization for non binary variables. Due to the increased computational load the expected speed-up should be more significant. Furthermore some optimizations are applicable in a general setting. It is planned to update the libDAI library accordingly.
