\section{Further Work}
To further improve the significance of the optimizations performed in this project some future work is proposed:

\begin{itemize}
\item Use vectors to represent the variable states. This would lift the restriction to binary belief propagation. Due to the increased computational load associated with each message by having more states some improvements (e.g. vectorization) could become more relevant.
\item Some optimizations are applicable in a general setting as well. It is planned to collect these improvements and include them in the original library.
\end{itemize}
