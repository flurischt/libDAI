%Here we provide some further tips.

%\mypar{Further general guidelines}

%\begin{itemize}
%\item For short papers, to save space, I use paragraph titles instead of
%subsections, as shown in the introduction.

%\item It is generally a good idea to break sections into such smaller
%units for readability and since it helps you to (visually) structure the story.

%\item The above section titles should be adapted to more precisely
%reflect what you do.

%\item Each section should be started with a very
%short summary of what the reader can expect in this section. Nothing
%more awkward as when the story starts and one does not know what the
%direction is or the goal.

%\item Make sure you define every acronym you use, no matter how
%convinced you are the reader knows it.

%\item Always spell-check before you submit (to me in this case).

%\item Be picky. When writing a paper you should always strive for very
%high quality. Many people may read it and the quality makes a big difference.
%In this class, the quality is part of the grade.

%\item Books helping you to write better: \cite{Higham:98} and \cite{Strunk:00}.

%\item Conversion to pdf (latex users only): 

%dvips -o conference.ps -t letter -Ppdf -G0 conference.dvi

%and then

%ps2pdf conference.ps
%\end{itemize}

%\mypar{Graphics} For plots that are not images {\em never} generate (even as intermediate step)
%jpeg, gif, bmp, tif. Use eps, which means encapsulate postscript, os pdf. This way it is
%scalable since it is a vector graphic description of your graph. E.g.,
%from Matlab, you can export to eps or pdf.

%Here is an example of how to get a plot into latex
%(Fig.~\ref{fftperf}). Note that the text should not be any smaller than shown.

%  discrete Fourier transform. The operations count is roughly the
%  same. {\em The labels in this plot are too small.}\label{fftperf}}
